# Unit Tests

## Getting Started

We use Minitest for the Ruby Security agent. 

Use this command to install required gems:

    rake test_bundle

### Running All Unit tests

The following command runs all the unit tests:

    rake test

### Running Specific Tests

You can run a single unit test file like this:

    ruby test/newrelic_security/instrumentation-security/kernel/kernel_test.rb
